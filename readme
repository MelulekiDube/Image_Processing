Assignment structure:
	-src/ contains all the source files except the testing file so everything .cpp goes into this directory apart from the tests
	-test/ contains the testing.cpp source file
	-build/ this contains the object files that have been compiled. Thefore all the .o files come here after comilation
	-include/ this contains all the header files. that is all the .h files
	-bin/ contains the executables that is the imageops_run and the imageops_testing.run
	resources/ this are the image files and filter file that where used for testing the application
	-output/ this directory is where all the output will be written.
To run tests use make run_test
To run the imageops application use bin/imageops.run <option> Outputfile_name
use make clean to clean all the compiled code and executables.


Notes:
	- when passing the image values for option pass in the file names without including the .pgm extension as this will be added
	  by the programm when opening the file. This is to so as to ensure that only .pgm files are passed.
	- When you add images of different size an exception is thrown and there is no image which results from that.
	- the outputfilename should just contain the name of the file and no directories are allowed. This was done as to ensure that all
	  files will be placed to the same file.
	- at every make rule a message is passed to let you know what is happening at a particular time.
	-for feed back also the user has print statements of the different steps being taken by the application
